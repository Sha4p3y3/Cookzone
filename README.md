# Cookzone - Restaurant Mangement System

A Bits Pilani - WILP MTech project

**Subject:** Database design and Applications

Group BF

###	Purpose

The main purpose of the restaurant management project is to digitalize and streamline the operations performed at a restaurant thus making the order taking process faster, providing the best customer experience and reducing the manual errors in taking orders.

### Scope

The project aims to provide an intuitive and efficient interface for the customers/order-takers at the restaurant to take order(s), track the order(s), and billing the order(s). It also provides a seamless digital process for the restaurant to take orders and provide the restaurant management with an error prone billing solution. 

### Domain

The proposed project aims at providing a digital solution to the restaurant for all their operations. The large domain will result in an equally large scope of development. So, we narrow our case study/project for a small restaurant named Cookzone to manage its own small restaurant with few basic functionalities.
